<p><i>mnm is not mail.</i></p>

<p>The mnm project is building a replacement for email: a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/networkimprov/mnm-hammer">client</a> (this app), a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/networkimprov/mnm">server</a>, and a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/networkimprov/mnm/blob/master/Protocol.md">simple 
protocol</a> (TMTP) between them. 
</p>

<p>mnm has two major goals.</p>

<ol><li>To provide a far safer correspondence model, where you:  
<br>+ choose the organizations/sites that relay your correspondence  
<br>+ select which members of a site can correspond with you  
<br>+ always know from which site a message originated  
<br>+ can block anyone with whom you've made contact  
<br>+ may leave a site and never see traffic from it again  
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>To offer capabilities missing in traditional email, including:  
<br>+ forms/surveys whose results are collected into tables  
<br>+ data-driven charts via [a JS chart library TBD]  
<br>+ slide deck layouts  
<br>+ hashtags and private tags  
<br>+ hyperlinks to messages &amp; other threads  
<br>+ message formatting &amp; layout via Markdown (aka CommonMark)  
<br>+ many more features to foster efficiency, creativity, focus, and understanding  
</li></ol>

<h4 id="cryp">1a. Encryption</h4>

<p>mnm employs TLS (aka SSL) to secure connections between the app and each server it connects to. 
mnm does not offer end-to-end encryption (where apps en/decrypt messages before/after transmission). 
</p>

<p>The author encourages organizations that transmit highly sensitive information 
via electronic messaging to propose enhancements to the mnm software for their needs. 
</p>

<p>For individuals who desire end-to-end email encryption, 
the author suggests any of the secure, audited electronic mail offerings on the market. 
</p>


<h3 id="look">2. Look &amp; Feel</h3>

<p><b>Warning!</b> 
Confirmation dialogs for send, etc. are [not yet implemented]. 
Undo for edit, delete, etc. are [not yet implemented]. 
</p>

<p><b>Panels</b>.
mnm divides its screen into three panels. 
The message panel is on the left, 
so its left margin (the most-seen region for left-to-right languages) is free from distractions, 
helping the reader/writer to concentrate. 
The accounts panel is on the right, 
so its frequent activity notifications are far from the normal focus of the user. 
The thread index panel is between them.
</p>

<p><b>Colors</b>.
The color scheme is intended to reduce the glare of black-on-white
designs, and foster concentration. 
The accounts panel is dark, to de-emphasize its constant updates. 
Received and sent messages appear on a background reminiscent 
of parchment, to imply a sense of permanence. 
Input fields have a white background for emphasis.
</p>

<b>Controls</b>.
<table style="border-spacing:0 0.5em"><tr>
<td><span uk-icon="bell"></span></td>
<td>Feature menus are indicated by an icon without a border.</td>

<p><b>Browser Tabs</b>.
When you have multiple mnm accounts, each one is presented in a separate browser tab. 
Tabs may be closed and re-opened without impacting the app's connection to the TMTP service, 
as the app runs separately from the browser. 
</p>

<p>An mnm app optimized for small screens is ... 
[not yet implemented].
</p>


<h3 id="acct">3. Accounts</h3>

<p>The right-hand panel lists your accounts on TMTP services. 
The account presented in the current browser tab has a <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu 
which displays its configuration. 
Other accounts have a <span uk-icon="bell"></span> menu that summarizes recent activity therein. 
</p>

<p>An account's user ID (UID) and password are randomly generated by the service and stored on 
the client device. Both are equally unguessable. 
The UID is revealed to other service members only by sending or replying to an invite. 
The password is dedicated to one client device, and is never entered by hand. 
</p>

<p>To create an account, open the <span uk-icon="plus-circle"></span> menu and fill in the form. 
It takes the 
<i>Site Address</i> of the TMTP service (e.g. <tt>+someplace.net:443</tt>), 
<!--todo Connections to the service are periodic if <i>(Pd days:hh:mm:ss)</i> is set. -->
<i>Your Name/Alias</i> by which other service members know you, and the 
<i>Account Title</i> to display in the accounts panel 
(e.g. the name of the organization providing the service). 
The <i>Site Address</i> is prefixed by <tt>+</tt> or <tt>=</tt> to indicate 
whether the service's TLS certificate can be verified or not. 
Not all addresses contain a <tt>:number</tt> component. 
</p>

<p>A service may allow you to create more than one account. 
A service may require member-specific credentials (e.g. for Radius, Kerberos, or LDAP) 
[not yet implemented].
</p>

<p>If you give a name/alias that is in use by another service member, 
the account will be created, but not usable until you change the alias.
To do so, open the <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu on the accounts panel, 
and use the <i>Alias (taken)</i> field.
</p>

<p>If the mnm app cannot contact the service (e.g. because it is down, or the site address is incorrect), 
the account will be created, but not usable until it makes contact. 
To change the address, <!--todo i>(Pd days:hh:mm:ss),</i --> 
open the <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu on the accounts panel, 
and use the <i>Site</i> field. 
</p>

<p>To change the <i>Account Title</i>, [not yet implemented]. 
</p>


<h4 id="alis">3a. Aliases</h4>

<p>Aliases are the names by which service members know each other. 
An alias conveyed verbally or by phone is used in an invite to make initial contact 
with another service member. 
Users may create additional aliases after joining a service, corresponding to different roles, etc. 
</p>

<p>To create an alias, open the <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu on the accounts panel, 
and use the <i>+Alias</i> form. 
[not yet implemented on client]
</p>

<p>Aliases cannot be transferred to a different account (and therefore cannot be removed), 
but may be deactivated and reactivated.
[not yet implemented]
</p>


<h4 id="repl">3b. Replicas</h4>

<p>You can replicate your accounts on other devices running the mnm app. 
Each copy of an account is known as a replica, and has a unique, server-generated password. 
All replicas receive every message sent to the account. 
Replicas provide automatic backup of account data, and access to it from multiple devices. 
</p>

<p>Private content (e.g. message tags, message seen status, the last-seen notice, ohi-to contacts, 
pinned tabs, and account configuration) is kept in sync across your replicas. 
Synchronization updates are distributed every two minutes. 
Synchronization of message drafts and invite drafts is 
[not yet implemented].
Peer-to-peer synchronization between replicas residing on the same local network is 
[not yet implemented].
</p>

<p>Replicas of an account are listed in the <span uk-icon="laptop"></span> menu. 
The <i>first</i> entry represents the original instance of the account. 
The login status and history for each replica is 
[not yet implemented].
</p>

<p>To create a replica, open the <span uk-icon="cog"></span> menu above the accounts panel 
on the destination device, 
and click the <span uk-icon="laptop"></span><span uk-icon="arrow-left"></span> button. 
The menu will display the address and pin required to make a replica. 
On the origin device, open the <span uk-icon="laptop"></span> menu and fill in the form with the 
<i>Target Address</i> and <i>Target Pin</i> you've obtained. 
Also provide a <i>New replica name</i>, and then click the <span uk-icon="laptop"></span> button. 
</p>

<p>Creating a replica is easy between devices on the same local network. 
When one of the devices is non-local, the <i>Target Address</i> must give the public IP address 
of the destination device, and any firewalls between that device and the Internet 
must be configured to allow incoming traffic on the mnm app's HTTP port (typically 8123).
After a replica is created, the devices can reside on different networks without special configuration.
</p>

<p>If a replication cannot be completed immediately, the replica's status will indicate 
<i>Pending</i> if the account's service is unreachable, or 
<i>Accepted</i> if the destination device becomes unreachable, or 
<i>Ready</i> if the origin device crashed after the destination received all the data. 
To complete a replication, obtain and fill in the <i>Target Address</i> and <i>Target Pin</i> as above, 
then click the <span uk-icon="laptop"></span> button in the entry for the incomplete replica. 
A <i>Pending</i> or <i>Accepted</i> replica can be completed on a different destination device. 
</p>

<p>To rename a replica, open the <span uk-icon="laptop"></span> menu and ...
[not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>To deactivate a replica, open the <span uk-icon="laptop"></span> menu and ... 
[not yet implemented]
</p>


<h3 id="cont">4. Contacts</h3>

<p>The <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu groups features for managing contacts, 
i.e. other members of the service with whom you can correspond.
</p>


<h4 id="invt">4a. Invitations</h4>

<p>A service member makes initial contact with another member by sending an invite (a.k.a. ping). 
Invites include the sender's UID &amp; alias, the recipient's alias, 
an optional group name (GID), and an optional short, plain-text message. 
The sender is not notified if the recipient's alias is deactivated. 
</p>

<p>Invites are also generated for any original or subsequent thread recipients 
with whom the others have not previously made contact. 
Such invites display the message <i>via [Contact Name]</i> and a response hyperlink to the 
thread in question. 
</p>

<p>Receipt of an invite adds the sender's UID &amp; alias to the recipient's address book. 
The recipient may respond by sending an invite themselves, by starting a thread 
with the sender, or by joining the group if one is included. 
Issuing a response is optional. 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">Received and generated invites are logged 
in the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu under the <i>Invites</i> tab. 
Sent invites are logged under the <i>Sent</i> tab. 
Items in these tabs for which responses have been sent or received indicate the date of the response 
and its type: 
</p>

<div style="margin: 0 2em; float:left">
   <span uk-icon="rss"></span> for an invite, <br>
   <span uk-icon="mail"></span> (a hyperlink) for a thread, 
</div><div>
   <span uk-icon="check"></span> for an accepted group invitation, <br>
   <span uk-icon="plus-circle"></span> if the recipient joined the group. 
</div> 

<p>To view the thread &amp; message that delivered an invite response, 
click the <span uk-icon="mail"></span> hyperlink, 
which adds a <b>&#x2992;</b>&nbsp;<i>Response</i> tab above the message list.
(For responses of other types, no hyperlink appears on the invite.)
</p>

<p>To compose an invite, open the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu, 
select the <i>Drafts</i> tab, and enter an alias in the <i>To</i> field. 
To include a group in the invitation, click the <span uk-icon="world"></span> hyperlink 
to reveal the <i>Group</i> field and enter a group name (see <a href="#grup">Groups</a>). 
Click the <span uk-icon="pencil"></span> button to create a draft invite. 
Add a <i>Message</i> to the draft if desired; its text is automatically saved. 
The <i>Message</i> is limited to 140 characters, but most emoji count for two characters. 
A draft's <i>To</i> and <i>Group</i> fields cannot be updated; to change them, 
delete the draft and create another. 
</p>

<p>To send an invite, click its <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button. 
If it cannot be sent immediately, it is queued, which is indicated 
by the <span uk-icon="bolt"></span> icon on the draft. 
</p>

<p>To delete a draft unsent, click its <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button. 
</p>

<p>After receiving an invite or a thread started in response to a sent invite, the recipient 
may block further communication from the sender (see <a href="#bloc">Blocking</a>). 
The sender is not notified that the recipient blocked them. 
[not yet implemented]
</p>


<h4 id="grup">4b. Groups</h4>

<p>A group provides an alias to a set of service members. 
As currently designed, 
this feature is suitable for communities of friends or colleagues who trust each other, 
not for public discussions to which any service member can subscribe. 
One joins a group by accepting an invite from a current group participant. 
Existing participants receive a notification when someone joins, leaves, 
updates their group membership info, or issues an invite. 
A message delivered via a group does not list the participants who received it. 
Group membership lists are stored on the TMTP server. 
</p>

<p>Groups which the user has joined or created are listed in the <span uk-icon="users"></span> 
menu under the <i>Groups</i> tab. 
Those created by the user are marked with <span class="group-admin">&#x24b6;</span>. 
Received and sent invitations are logged in the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu 
under the <i>Invites</i> and <i>Sent</i> tabs.
</p>

<p>To invite someone to join a group, compose an invite including the group name 
(see <a href="#invt">Invitations</a>). 
If the group name is unknown and available, it will be created. 
On the <i>Drafts</i> tab, the <i>Choose group</i> field presents a menu of known groups. 
To copy a name from the menu into the <i>Group</i> field, press enter after selecting a menu item. 
Having created a draft, add a <i>Message</i> if desired and send the invite. 
</p>

<p>To join a group in response to an invite, open the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu, 
select the <i>Invites</i> tab, and click the <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button 
next to the group name. 
If the acceptance cannot be sent immediately, it is queued, which is indicated
by the <span uk-icon="bolt"></span> icon on the invite. 
</p>

<p>To list a group's membership, any current participant may... 
[not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>To change one's group membership info, any current participant may...

</p>

<p>To drop oneself or another group participant from the group, any current participant may... 
[not yet implemented on client]
</p>


<h4 id="ohis">4c. Ohis</h4>

<p>A service member may designate contacts to be notified when dis/connecting from/to the service. 
This presence notification is referred to as an ohi. 
Service members automatically receive ohis from any contacts who have so designated them. 
Ohis do not carry a message. 
</p>

<p>The list of online contacts who have chosen to notify you appears 
in a floating panel with dark background at the bottom-right corner of the threads panel. 
Those contacts whom you also notify are flagged with &#x25ce;. 
To hide or show the floating panel, click the o/ icon next to the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu. 
</p>

<p>To add a contact to receive ohis from you, open the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu, 
select the <i>Ohi To</i> tab, use the <i>To</i> field to select an alias, press enter, 
then click the o/ button. 
</p>

<p>To drop a contact receiving ohis from you, open the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu,
select the <i>Ohi To</i> tab, and click the <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button for that contact. 
</p>

<p>Ohis are not delivered to a recipient who has blocked the sender. 
</p>


<h4 id="bloc">4d. Blocking Other Members</h4>

<p>[Not yet implemented].
</p>


<h3 id="upld">5. Attachable Files</h3>

<p>Files attached to outgoing messages are added to the <span uk-icon="file-text"></span> menu. 
A file may be safely removed from the menu after it's been attached, 
but leaving it there doesn't consume any extra storage space. 
Files may also be uploaded to this menu without attaching them. 
</p>

<p>To upload a file, open the <span uk-icon="file-text"></span> menu, 
click the <i>Choose File</i> or <i>Browse</i> button and select a file, 
amend the upload name as necessary, and click the <span uk-icon="push"></span> button. 
Uploading by drag-and-drop is [not yet implemented]. 
</p>

<p>To copy a file attachment from the most-recently selected thread to the 
<span uk-icon="file-text"></span> menu, open the <span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> menu 
and click the attachment's <span uk-icon="push"></span> button. 
[not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>The list of files may be sorted using the <i>Date</i> and <i>Name</i> tabs. 
</p>

<p>To download a file, click its <span uk-icon="download"></span> hyperlink. 
(Note: the &#x25a1; character is appended to download filenames which may be reserved by the OS.) 
To preview a file, click its filename hyperlink. 
Files that can be previewed display a <span uk-icon="triangle-left"></span> icon. 
</p>

<p>To delete a file, click its <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button. 
</p>


<h3 id="form">6. Blank Forms</h3>

<p>Users may create forms/surveys, similar to those on web pages, 
to request specific data from their correspondents. 
Blank forms are shared as attachments. 
Filled-form results are returned as attachments, 
and automatically appended to <a href="#fftb">Filled-Form Tables</a>. 
</p>

<p>Blank forms are grouped into families. 
All forms in a family produce results containing the same set of fields (i.e. data type). 
Form names have the format <tt><i>family.revision</i></tt>. 
Each revision defines a variation of the form (e.g. for use with different audiences). 
A family with more than one revision must also have a <tt><i>family.</i>spec</tt> object. 
A blank form spec defines the data type produced by the family, and is used to validate 
filled-form results. 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">A blank form spec may contain a data type specification, 
or a filled-form name (FFN) that points into an online repository of specifications. 
[In this release, any FFN lookup returns the contents of the file <i>formspec</i> in the app directory.]
A data type specification is a JSON object with an array of field definitions. 
Each definition has <tt>name</tt>, <tt>status</tt>, and <tt>type</tt> members. 
An array definition also has an <tt>array</tt> member indicating the number of dimensions. 
Type <tt>object</tt> fields have a nested <tt>spec</tt> list. 
This example illustrates all the options: 
</p>

<pre style="background-color:inherit; border:none; margin:0">{"spec":[
  {"name":"nr", "status":"required",   "type":"number" },
  {"name":"so", "status":"optional",   "type":"string" },
  {"name":"bd", "status":"deprecated", "type":"bool"   },
  {"name":"or", "status":"required",   "type":"object", "spec":[
    {"name":"anr", "status":"required", "type":"number", "array":2},
    {"name":"aso", "status":"optional", "type":"string", "array":1}] }
]}
</pre>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">This version of mnm embeds the 
Vue Form Generator to render blank forms and produce results from user input. 
See the <a target="_blank" href="https://icebob.gitbooks.io/vueformgenerator/content/schema.html"
>VFG docs</a> covering form definition objects. 
This example definition conforms to the above specification: 
</p>

<pre style="background-color:inherit; border:none; margin:0">{"fields":[
  {"label":"SO", "model":"so", "type":"input", "inputType":"text"},
  {"label":"NR", "model":"nr", "type":"input", "inputType":"number"},
  {"label":"ASR", "model":"or.asr", "type":"checklist", "listBox":true,
   "values":["a","b"]},
  {"label":"ANO", "model":"or.ano", "type":"checklist", "listBox":true,
   "values":[{"name":"12", "value":[1,2]},
             {"name":"22", "value":[2,2]}] }
]}
</pre>

<p>Blank form field names, given by <tt>name</tt> variables in a <tt>spec</tt> list, 
and <tt>model</tt> variables in a form definition, may not begin with <tt>$</tt> (dollar sign), 
as mnm uses that symbol internally. 
</p>

<p>To create a blank form, open the <span class="questionbox">&#x2370;</span> menu, 
enter a family name and optional revision name (separated by ".") 
in the <i>New Type</i> field, and click the <span uk-icon="pencil"></span> button. 
For a blank form spec, use the revision name <tt>.spec</tt>.
</p>

<p>To edit a new or existing form, open the <span class="questionbox">&#x2370;</span> menu 
and click its <span uk-icon="triangle-left"></span> hyperlink to open the form editor. 
Next click the <tt>{...}</tt> hyperlink to switch to code view, and begin editing. 
Click <tt>{...}</tt> again to preview changes. 
Edits are automatically saved, except when the code is not valid JSON. 
Closing the editor or switching to a different form drops the latest invalid changes, if any. 
</p>

<p>To copy an existing form to a new revision, open the form editor for the source form 
and enter a revision name (without the family name) 
in the <span uk-icon="copy"></span> form at the bottom of the editor panel. 
</p>

<p>To copy a blank form attachment from the most-recently selected thread to the 
<span class="questionbox">&#x2370;</span> menu, open the <span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> menu 
and click the attachment's <span uk-icon="push"></span> button. 
[not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>The list of forms may be sorted using the <i>Date</i> and <i>Name</i> tabs. 
Families remain grouped when sorted by date. 
</p>

<p>To delete a form, click its <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button. 
</p>


<h3 id="thrd">7. Thread Lists &amp; Search</h3>

<p>The middle panel presents the service's logo (if available) [not yet implemented] 
and the account title, followed by a listing from the thread index.

[not yet implemented]. 
To sort the thread list by the date of the most recent message in each thread, click ... 
[not yet implemented].
</p>

<p>Within the thread list, the two right-hand columns give the date of the initial message 
and either its sender, or its recipients (in <i>italics</i>) when this account is the initial sender.
</p>

<p>Threads with unopened messages present the date &amp; sender of the most recent message 
in <b>boldface</b> text. 
</p>

<p>To display a thread in the left-hand panel, click its line in the list. 
This adds the thread to the set of recently selected threads (history).

<h4 id="fftb">7a. Filled-Form Tables</h4>

<p>Both received and sent filled-form results are appended to a table for the associated 
form type (aka FFN).
The filled-form tables are listed in the <span uk-icon="database"></span> menu, by date of last update. 
This menu does not appear if no filled-form results have been recorded.
See also <a href="#form">Blank Forms</a>. 
</p>

<p>To view a filled-form table in a separate thread panel tab, open the 
<span uk-icon="database"></span> menu and click the hyperlink for the table. 
</p>

<p>To view the thread &amp; message that delivered a specific filled-form table entry, 
click its <span uk-icon="mail"></span> hyperlink,
which adds a <b>&#x2992;</b>&nbsp;<i>Form result</i> tab above the message list. 
</p>

<p>Future versions of mnm will provide filled-form table queries, 
and operations on query results. 
</p>


<h4 id="evtb">7b. Calendar Events</h4>

<p>Event objects attached to received and sent messages are added to the events table. 
Events may also be uploaded to the table, or downloaded from an iCalender service. 
[Not yet implemented]
</p>


<h3 id="msgs">8. Messages</h3>

<p>The left-hand panel presents the subject and message list for the most-recently selected thread. 
If the thread has multiple subjects, the subject field becomes a menu (denoted by &#x25BD;) 
headed by the subject of the most recent message. 
</p>

<p>After clicking either a row in the thread list or the 
<span uk-icon="arrow-left"></span><span uk-icon="arrow-right"></span> hyperlinks,
the message list may be scrolled with the arrow keys.
</p>

<p>The message list displays a header for every message in the thread. 
The tabs above the list control which messages are open (i.e. fully shown). 
<i>Open</i> shows messages which the user has directly opened (or in the case of sent 
messages, not yet closed). 
<i>All</i> shows all messages. 
</p>

<p>To show all messages containing a specific tag, select the tag name from
the <span uk-icon="hashtag"></span> menu, which adds a <i>#Tagname</i> tab 
(see also <a href="#tags">Tags</a>).
</p>

<p>To show any messages containing a phrase, enter the phrase in the search box and press enter, 
which adds a tab for the phrase. 
</p>

<p>Clicking a message hyperlink in a received/sent message or draft preview 
adds a <b>&#x2992;</b>&nbsp;<i>Linkname</i> tab above the message list showing 
only the referenced message (see also <a href="#mark">Markdown</a>). 
If a tab for the referenced message already exists, its title is instead updated to the latest linkname. 
</p>

<p>To open or close a message, click the message header (contains the date, time, and sender's alias). 
While a newly-opened message is loading, <span uk-icon="future"></span> is displayed. 
</p>

<p>All attachments received or sent in messages of the thread (except filled-form results) 
are listed in the <span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> menu. 
The list may be sorted using the <i>Date</i>, <i>Who</i>, <i>File</i>, and <i>Size</i> tabs. 
</p>

<p>To view the message that delivered an item in the <span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> menu, 
click the <span uk-icon="mail"></span> hyperlink for the item,
which adds a <b>&#x2992;</b>&nbsp;<i>Attached</i> tab above the message list.
</p>

<p>To download a file in the <span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> menu, 
click its <span uk-icon="download"></span> hyperlink. 
(Note: the &#x25a1; character is appended to download filenames which may be reserved by the OS.) 
To preview a file or form, click its name hyperlink. 
Attachments that can be previewed display a <span uk-icon="triangle-left"></span> icon. 
</p>


<h4 id="rcpt">8a. Recipients</h4>

<p>Individuals or groups who have received a copy of the thread are listed 
in the <span uk-icon="social"></span> menu. 
Those who have unsubscribed from the thread do not receive new messages, and are 
indicated by <span style="text-decoration:line-through">&nbsp;Recipient Name&nbsp;</span>. 
The recipients list may be sorted using the <i>Date</i>, <i>Who</i>, and <i>By</i> tabs. 
Each list item may include a <i>Note</i> written by the member who added that recipient. 
To view the <i>Note</i>, mouse over a recipient's name in the list. 
</p>

<p>To forward a thread to new recipients (or resubscribe unsubscribed recipients), 
open the <span uk-icon="social"></span> menu, 
edit the <i>Note</i> field to indicate why you've added this recipient if desired, 
use the <i>Forward to</i> field to select an alias or group, 
and click the <span uk-icon="list"></span> button (or press enter); repeat for other recipients. 
(Recipients won't receive anything unless the thread is forwarded.) 
To remove a recipient from the forward, click the &times; button for the target item. 
Click the <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button to forward the thread to the new recipients. 
</p>

<p>A forwarded thread is delivered without any attachments. 
These pending attachments are automatically delivered separately by their original senders. 
This policy prevents the transmission of malware disguised as a benign attachment from a trusted sender. 
A copy of each message is also automatically delivered by its original sender. 
Until the copy is received, the sender's name on the message is labeled <i>[unverified]</i>, 
and the label's hover text gives the identity of the account that forwarded the thread. 
If the original copy does not match the forwarded version, the sender's name is labeled 
<i>[possibly forged]</i>.
</p>


<h4 id="recv">8b. Received/Sent Messages</h4>

<p>Heretofore unopened messages present the date &amp; author in bold text in the header. 
</p>

<p>Open messages display the list of attachments, if any, immediately below the header. 
To close the list, click the 1<span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> icon.
</p>

<p>To download a file attachment, click its <span uk-icon="download"></span> hyperlink. 
To preview a file or form, click its name hyperlink. 
Attachments that can be previewed display a <span uk-icon="triangle-right"></span> icon. 
To view a filled-form result, click its name hyperlink. 
Filled-form attachments display a <span uk-icon="file-edit"></span> icon.
Pending attachments in forwarded threads display a <span uk-icon="bolt"></span> icon.
</p>

<p>The <i>Subject</i> field appears as <i>Re: etc</i>, if present.
The <i>Message text</i> displays <span uk-icon="comment"></span> if it's empty. 
</p>

<p>Both the <i>Subject</i> and <i>Message text</i> may contain Unicode characters, 
however the typeface in use typically won't include a rendering of every possible character.
To accommodate commonly written characters that are omitted in many typefaces, 
the mnm app varies the typeface within a message [not yet implemented].
Any invalid representations of Unicode that occur are altered by the browser to 
one or more <tt>&#xfffd;</tt> symbols.
To explore the Unicode universe, visit 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amp-what.com/">&amp;what;</a>.
</p>

<p>To change the typeface of a message, [not yet implemented].
</p>

<p>To reply to a message, click the <span uk-icon="comment"></span> button to the right 
of the header. 
</p>

<p>To reply to a message containing a blank form and include a filled-form result in the 
reply, click the <span uk-icon="commenting"></span> button above the form. 
Blank forms are fillable only in the preview panel of the draft editor. 
</p>


<h4 id="tags">8c. Tags</h4>

<p>A message may be assigned any number of predefined and user-defined tags, 
which allow threads and messages to be found via tag searches.
When a tag is sync'd to account replicas, on any device where that tag name is 
already in use by an account not replicated locally, 
the tag's name on that device will be changed to <i>tagname&nbsp;[account<sup>N</sup>]</i> 
(see also <a href="#repl">Replicas</a>).
</p>

<p>To set or clear a tag, open the message to be tagged, and use 
the <span uk-icon="tag"></span> menu that follows the sender's name in the message header.
</p>

<p>To create a new tag, use the <i>New Tag</i> form in the <span uk-icon="tag"></span> menu.
</p>

<p>To remove a tag from all messages where it appears... [not yet implemented] 
To rename a tag... [not yet implemented] 
</p>

<p>To list all threads containing a specific tag, 
use the <span uk-icon="hashtag"></span> menu next to the threads panel search box.
To show all messages within a thread containing a specific tag, 
use the <span uk-icon="hashtag"></span> menu next to the message panel search box.
</p>


<h4 id="comp">8d. Draft Composition</h4>

<p>Starting a new thread or a reply within an existing thread opens a draft editor. 
Its input fields are the Attachment list (optional), 
the <i>Subject</i> (optional for replies), and the <i>Message text</i> (optional). 
The <i>Subject</i> (a.k.a. <i>Re</i>) is minimized on replies by default; 
to edit it, click the thin white bar above the <i>Message text</i> field. 
Edits to all fields are automatically saved; 
the <i>Subject</i> and <i>Message text</i> are saved periodically during editing. 
</p>

<p>New draft threads (but not replies) are automatically tagged with <i>Todo</i>, so appear in the 
<i>#Todo</i> thread listing. 
You can remove the tag at any time. 
Automatic tagging can be disabled in the <span uk-icon="cog"></span> menu 
[not yet implemented]. 
See also <a href="#tags">Tags</a>. 
</p>

<p>To preview the <i>Message text</i> as it would look to recipients, press <tt>Ctrl-J</tt>. 
The preview panel always appears in the same position, even if there are multiple open drafts 
in the current message list.
A panel that scrolls with the message list is [not yet implemented].
To hide the preview panel, press <tt>Ctrl-J</tt> again or click anywhere outside the draft's 
<i>Message text</i> or <i>Subject</i>. 
</p>

<p>To preview all slides in a slide deck, click the &Lang;. . .&Rang; hyperlink on the preview panel. 
To return to normal deck preview, click the hyperlink again. 
</p>

<p>To name recipients of a new thread, open the <span uk-icon="social"></span> menu, 
edit the <i>Note</i> field to indicate why you've added this recipient if desired, 
use the <i>To</i> field to select an alias or group, 
and click the <span uk-icon="list"></span> button (or press enter); repeat for other recipients. 
(Recipients won't receive anything unless the draft is sent.) 
To remove a recipient from the list, click the &times; button for the target item.
</p>

<p>The draft gives a summary of recipients next to the <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button. 
If no recipients have been named, the draft indicates <i>[self]</i>.
</p>

<p>To attach a file or blank form, click the <span uk-icon="file-text"></span> or 
<span class="questionbox">&#x2370;</span> icon (below the <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button) 
to open the appropriate menu,

To display an image or blank form in the <i>Message text</i>, see <a href="#mark">Markdown</a>. 
</p>

<p>To drop an entry in the Attachment list, click the list's pop-up menu to reveal its contents, 
then click the &times; button for the target item. 
If an entry in the Attachment list is referenced by <a href="#mark">Markdown</a> in 
the <i>Message text</i>, dropping that list item disables the <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button. 
</p>

<p>To add/drop a filled-form result to/from the Attachment list, click the 
<i>attach fill</i> checkbox above the form in the preview panel. 
If adding a result, also fill in the form fields. 
(Requires a blank form in the <i>Message text</i>; see <a href="#mark">Markdown</a>.) 
</p>

<p>To send a draft, click its <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button. 
If it cannot be sent immediately, it is queued, which is indicated 
by the <span uk-icon="bolt"></span> icon to the right of the header. 
</p>

<p>To delete a draft unsent, click its <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button. 
</p>


<h4 id="mark">8e. Markdown</h4>

<p>The <i>Message text</i> supports Markdown, a widely used plain-text shorthand 
for essential web page features. 
Markdown avoids the unpredictable behavior of browser WYSIWYG editors. 
Consult the <a target="_blank" href="http://commonmark.org/help/">CommonMark Reference</a> and 
<a target="_blank"
   href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/organizing-information-with-tables"
>Github's Markdown Tables</a> for documentation. 

<p>To view a summary of Markdown options in mnm, click the <span class="draftpv-doctab"></span> 
tab in the top-left corner of the preview panel.
Alternatively, press <tt>Ctrl-M</tt> while editing a thread draft. 
Repeating <tt>Ctrl-M</tt> advances to the next frame of options, then closes the summary sidebar.
</p>

<p>mnm extends and amends Markdown as follows: 
</p>

<p><b>Images</b> must reference a file in the Attachment list, or one attached to a previous 
message in the current thread. 
This prevents the sender from forcing the recipient's browser to contact an Internet site 
without the recipient's consent. 
</p>

<p>For a file in the Attachment list, write:          <tt>![<i>alt</i>](this_u:<i>file_name</i>)</tt>
<br>For a file attached to a previous message, write: <tt>![<i>alt</i>](<i>file_ref</i>)</tt>
<br>To obtain the code above, open the <span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> menu, 
click the <span uk-icon="link"></span> hyperlink for the target file, then paste the 
string into your <i>Message text</i>. 
<tt>alt</tt> is any desired text. 
</p>

<p><b>Blank Forms</b> must reference a form in the Attachment list, or one attached to a previous 
message in the current thread. 
Any blank form with a reference that's already in use is ignored.
</p>

<p>For a form in the Attachment list, write:          <tt>![?](this_f:<i>form_name</i>)</tt>
<br>For a form attached to a previous message, write: <tt>![?](<i>form_ref</i>)</tt>
<br>To obtain the code above, open the <span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> menu, 
click the <span uk-icon="link"></span> hyperlink for the target form, then paste the 
string into your <i>Message text</i>. 
</p>

<p><b>Hyperlinks</b> may reference a remote site, or a file attached to a message 
in the current thread, or a previous message in any thread. 
References to relative URLs are disallowed. 
</p>

<p>For a remote site, write:                          <tt>[<i>text</i>](<i>url</i>)</tt>
<br>For a file in the Attachment list, write:         <tt>[<i>text</i>](this_u:<i>file_name</i>)</tt>
<br>For a file attached to a previous message, write: <tt>[<i>text</i>](<i>file_ref</i>)</tt>
<br>For a previous message in any thread, write:      <tt>[<i>text</i>](<i>msg_ref</i>)</tt>
<br>To obtain the attachment code above, use the <span class="paperclip">&#x1f4ce;</span> menu 
as previously described. 
To obtain the message code above, open the target message, click the <span uk-icon="link"></span> hyperlink 
to the right of the header, then paste the string into your <i>Message text</i>. 
<tt>text</tt> is any desired text. 
</p>

<p><b>Charts</b> [not yet implemented]
</p>

<p><b>Slides</b> let you format a message (or portion thereof) as a deck of slides. 
Among other benefits, slides can be used to present a lot of information 
without immediately intimidating the reader. 
To create a slide deck, write:
<tt style="display:block; margin:0.1em 2em; line-height:1.2">
    <i>optional content above deck</i>
<br>:::
<br><i>first slide content</i>
<br>:::
<br><i>next slide content</i>
<br>:::&gt;
<br><i>optional content below deck</i>
</tt>
The <tt>:::&gt;</tt> is unnecessary if no content follows the deck. 
A message can contain any number of separate decks. 
</p>


<h3 id="notc">9. Notices &amp; Errors</h3>

<p>New updates to an account are noted in the <span uk-icon="bell"></span> menu 
next to the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu, 
and in the <span uk-icon="bell"></span> menus provided for each account on the accounts panel. 
Notices appear for invites, messages, new threads, group membership changes, and [more]. 
A count of new notices appears to the left of the menu icon. 
[partially implemented] 
</p>

<p>If a notice has a blurb, an ellipsis (<i>. . .</i>) appears within it. 
To show or hide the blurb, click anywhere on the notice. 
</p>

<p>To show a subset of notices, click the <i>&bull; invites</i> (etc) hyperlinks at the top of the menu. 
</p>

<p>To mark all new notices as seen and drop any previously seen notices older than one week, click the 
<span uk-icon="check"></span> button at the top of the menu. 
The period for which seen notices are retained is configurable [not yet implemented].
</p>

<p>If mnm encounters an error, a <span style="color:crimson" uk-icon="warning"></span> 
appears beside the top <span uk-icon="bell"></span> menu, and 
an error message is posted to the <span uk-icon="warning"></span> section within the menu. 
That section is shown when you open the menu after an error occurs.
</p>


<h3 id="conf">10. General Configuration</h3>

<p>General configuration for the mnm app is listed in the <span uk-icon="cog"></span> menu.
